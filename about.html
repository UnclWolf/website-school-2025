About Us – The Heart of Taranaki, Packed into Every Sausage
Welcome to our Sausage of the Month Club — the tastiest decision you’ll ever make.
Here in Inglewood, Taranaki, we’re surrounded by rolling green pastures, skilled farmers, and a community that knows a thing or two about good food. We take those fresh, locally sourced ingredients and turn them into bold, unforgettable sausages that will make your taste buds stand up and applaud.
Every month, our subscribers get something new, exciting, and mouth-watering. One month it might be a smoky Spanish chorizo that brings the fiesta to your plate, the next it could be a buttery pork & apple blend that’s perfect with mashed potatoes, or a garlic-packed bratwurst ready for the barbecue. We keep it fresh, seasonal, and always bursting with flavour.
We don’t do supermarket shortcuts — no filler, no blandness, no cutting corners. Every sausage is hand-mixed in small batches, packed with care, and delivered straight to your door in eco-friendly packaging. We want you to smell the quality before you even take your first bite.
Our mission is simple:
Support local farmers.


Make sausages so good they stop conversations.


Deliver happiness, one sizzling package at a time.


Whether you’re a weekend griller, a weekday meal-prep hero, or a kitchen experimenter who loves trying something new, our Sausage of the Month subscription will keep your meals exciting and your fridge well-stocked with deliciousness.
So go on — join the club, fire up the pan, and taste the best of Taranaki, one sausage at a time.
